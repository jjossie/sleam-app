# Sleam - Seamless Sonic Sleep Experience
An Android App started as a group project for an Object-Oriented Development class. This app is mean to provide the user with both relaxing music or sounds to fall asleep to, as well as morning alarm music or sounds. Several apps provide one or the other, but few provide both. Sleam is meant to be a customizable seamless sonic sleep experience.
